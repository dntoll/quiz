# Assignment 1. 12/12 2013 

## What would you include in a test-plan?
 - All relevant specific test-cases are specified in detail.
 + A record of all requirements that we intend to focus on
 + A list of risks that could affect testing
 + A due end date.
 + Specification on what kinds of testing we are to conduct.

## What is traceability?
	Mark what is true about traceability.
- Traceability is to have reproducible tests results.
+ A way of connecting a failing test to the feature requested by a customer.
+ Traceability can be used to minimize the set of tests needed.
+ The ability to connect Non functional requirements to test-cases
+ The ability to connect functional requirements to test-cases
- Traceability is testing of a non functional requirement
+ the ability to remove invalid test-cases when a requirement is changed.

## Traceability, How can we achieve it?
+ By naming convention (name, number) of the use cases and test cases
+ By a test matrix, showing dependencies
- By making sure we have a limited input domain
- By testing functional requirements
- by doing compatibility testing

## How can we make sure that we have full path coverage on a use-case that contains a loop?
- Randomly create scenarios from a use-case activity diagram
- We cannot derive tests from Use-cases
+ Create test cases from paths and make sure all paths are covered in the use-case activity diagram.

## What are examples of non-functional requirements?
+ The system should have 99% uptime.
+ The system should have maximum response time of 1 second.
+ The system must use a mysql database.

## How can security be tested on a web-application.
+ Exploratory testing of input constraints
+ Try SQL-Injections on input fields
+ Manual inspection of cookies 
+ Making sure login forms are delivered over HTTPS
+ Making sure a session cookie cannot be created unless we are using HTTPS
+ Try to accessing restricted content when not logged in.

## Is exploratory testing automated?
 + No
 - Yes

## What is regression testing?
- It is to test new requirements that has never been tested before.
+ It is to rerun testing of requirements that already has been tested once without changing anything
+ It is to rerun testing of requirements that already has been tested after a change.
+ It is intended to help us avoid introducing faults when we change the system.

## What are the advantages of exploratory testing?
+ ET tests tests the system as it is not intended to be used.
+ ET avoids the saturation effect by introducing new ways of testing.
+ In ET you deduct new tests from the experience of previous tests
- We can review the tests in advance.
- Can easily be reproduced.

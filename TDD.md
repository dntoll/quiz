# Lecture. TDD
	This quiz is intended to test you on the content of the lecture on TDD

## What is the goal of testing?
	Check all that apply
 - To completely verify that the code is correct
 + Uncovering errors
 + Build confidence in the software
 - prove correctness
 + get better understanding of the problem
 
## What is the reason behind long turnaround time?
	Check all that apply
 - Long coffee-breaks 
 + Testers and programmers work against eachother
 - regression testing is automated
 + We use manual testing
 + We implement too much before testing
 
## Faster!, harder!, scooter!
	Check all that apply
 - TDD is faster than traditional development
 + TDD finds more bugs

## What is the order of TDD 
	Check all that apply
 - Write test, write code, run tests, refactor
 - write code, refactor, write test, run tests
 - write test, run tests, refactor, run tests
 + Write test, run tests, make change to code, run tests, remove duplication
 
## What is an assert?
	Check all that apply
 + A method that throws an exception when it receives false input
 - A mock object
 + A part of the JUnit framework
 + A code coverage tool
 
## How can exceptions be tested in JUnit4?
	Check all that apply
 + @Test(expected=Exception.class)
 - by using fail after running a method on the sut class
 
## How do we handle hard to test dependencies
 + By using dependency injection
 + By mocking
 - By avoiding dependencies between classes

## Do all tests need assert
 + No
 - Yes
 
## Does 100% coverage mean we are bug-free?
 + No
 - Yes
